# Alpamayo Recipes

A collection of end-to-end Alpamayo recipes for multiple versions (v1, v1.5, and beyond), designed
to help developers quickly build, adapt, and deploy Alpamayo-based applications. This repo
brings together battle-tested workflows across the Alpamayo ecosystem, including: post-training
recipes (supervised fine-tuning, reinforcement learning, and distillation), auto-labeling and data curation workflows, etc.
Whether you are experimenting locally or building a full production stack, this repository is
intended as the primary starting point for developers to learn, customize, and extend
Alpamayo for their own use cases.
